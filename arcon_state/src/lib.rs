//! `arcon_state` contains all state management related functionality for the arcon system.
//!
//! The crate provides a set of active in-memory state indexes that are backed by
//! state backend implementations [Backend]. Sled is used as the default state backend,
//! but `arcon_state` also supports RocksDB for production use cases.
//!
//! Users may add their own custom indexes as long as  the [IndexOps] trait is implemented.
