# Stream API

A `Stream` in Arcon represents an unbounded or bounded stream of data. 

Users may add a transformation on one Stream to produce another. The sequence of transformations
is added to a dataflow graph which is then later used to build the final Pipeline.

Streams are initially created from Arcon sources.

The section is split into the follow sub-sections: 

- [Operator Configuration](#operator-configuration)
- [Pre-defined Operators](#pre-defined-operators)
- [Adding Custom Operator](#adding-a-custom-operator)
- [Building the Pipeline](#building-the-pipeline)
