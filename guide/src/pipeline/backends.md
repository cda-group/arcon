# State Backends

Arcon's state management features are implemented in the `arcon_state` crate. 

If no other backend feature has been turned on, then [sled](https://github.com/spacejam/sled) is used as the default backend.
However, if the `rocksdb` feature is on, then RocksDB will be used as the default as it is more mature and in most cases performs better.
