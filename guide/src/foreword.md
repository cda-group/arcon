# Foreword

Arcon is a runtime for writing streaming applications with the Rust programming language.
The runtime is meant to be either used as a standalone library or in the future through the [Arc](https://github.com/cda-group/arc) programming language.

Do note that the project is currently in development and should be considered experimental until further notice.
