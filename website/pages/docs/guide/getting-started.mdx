# Setting up Rust

The easiest way to install Rust is to use the [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) tool.

# Cargo

Add Arcon as a dependency in your ``Cargo.toml``. Currently arcon does not have a stable version on crates.io, so 
we add a git dependency instead. Note that we also include [prost](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost) 
as it is required when declaring more complex Arcon data types.

```rust
[dependencies]
arcon = "0.2"
prost = "0.7"
```
