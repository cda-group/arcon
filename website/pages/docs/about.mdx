# Overview

Arcon is a runtime for writing real-time analytics applications with the Rust programming language. 
At the core, Arcon aims to enable users to build scalable stateful streaming applications with event-time semantics.

## Project Status

We are working towards stablising the APIs and the runtime.

Arcon is in development and should be considered experimental until further notice. 

## Background

Arcon is a research project developed at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and RISE Research Institutes of Sweden in Stockholm, Sweden.
